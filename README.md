## Touch: Command-line application to Create files

This is a command-line application. That creates one or more files but ignores existing files. This simple CLI application is made using C language.

> The purpose to make this program is to add the `touch` command in the Windows operating system just like Linux. Inspired by the Linux CLI command `touch`,  which is used to create files.

### Command:

```
touch [-help | /h] <filename | filenames>
```

- filename: Name of file to create.
- -help, /h: Display user guide documentation.

To create more than one file attach filenames using <file1> <file2> <file3> ... <fileN> format.
